#Problem 3 - Rearrange Array Digits

Rearranges the Numbers in an array into two Numbers, and the sum of the two Numbers is the largest. The array is sorted from largest to smallest, with the largest number at the top of the list. It then iterates through the set of Numbers, alternately putting one in num1 or num2, and finally returning num1 and num2

The time complexity is O(nlog(n)) , because I used Merge sort.

The space complexity is O(n), because I used Merge sort.
